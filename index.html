        <h1>Welcome to Our Website</h1>
        <p>
          Hello! Welcome to our website. Here, you can find information about
          us, our cause, and our CAS project in general. On this website, we
          showcase our work progress through photos, videos, and a blog.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our project comprises all of the three strands: creativity, activity,
          service. A unique idea of collecting funds for charity by having a
          bake sale, where we will sell organic and sugar-free options, shows
          that our project involves creativity as well as making creative
          posters to raise awareness about environmental issues. Other than
          creativity, we also engage in activity by planting trees and offering
          other children the opportunity to engage in volunteering work and
          collaboratively making change.

        <p>OCTOBER 15TH, 2025.<p>
            <p>We recently finished creating a new series of educational posters! They're about Georgia's enviromental pollution.  We also decided on a straightforward logo that captures our project's idea without detracting from the content in order to bring everything together. The project feels polished and ready to share now that the posters and logo are finished!

        <h1>Blog Post 3 - November 1st, 2025</h1>
        <p>To make our surroundings healthier and greener, our community came together on November 1st for a tree-planting event that united people of all ages.</p>  
        <img src="https://www.simpleimageresizer.com/_uploads/photos/38ba9936/591217711_1199927718769160_810215374273548376_n_1_33.png" alt="collage bp3">
        <p>In parks and along sidewalks we planted a variety of young trees. The day felt fun despite the physical labor.  We learned how trees promote cleaner soil and air,  bonded, and everyone felt proud of their contributions to something that will continue to grow for many years to come. Even though our new trees are small right now, they signify a positive beginning and serve as a reminder of what can be accomplished when we collaborate to protect the environment.</p>

  <h1>Blog Post 6 - November 30th, 2025</h1>
  <p>November 30th, 2025.<p>
      <p>The last blog post. We learned a lot from our environmental campaign.  We concentrated on important topics like recycling and volunteering and it was wonderful to see our community participate.</p>
      <img src="https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/thank-you-lettering_1262-6963.jpg?semt=ais_hybrid&w=740&q=80" alt="Thank you">

       <p>The campaign demonstrated how small actions, like using less plastic or conserving energy, can have a significant impact when everyone takes part.  I hope our efforts inspire others to make more sustainable decisions in their daily lives. It was encouraging to see how group action can bring about positive change.</p>

          <h3>Pollution Issues in Georgia</h3>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Air Pollution</strong>: Tbilisi, the capital, suffers from high air pollution, largely due to vehicle emissions and industrial activity.</li>
              <li><strong>Water Pollution</strong>: Rivers like the Rioni River are contaminated by agricultural runoff, untreated sewage, and industrial waste.</li>
              <li><strong>Waste Management</strong>: Georgia faces a growing waste management problem, with limited recycling and reliance on landfills for waste disposal.</li>
              <li><strong>Deforestation</strong>: Logging and agricultural expansion have led to significant deforestation, particularly in the Caucasus Mountains.</li>
        
         <h3>Solutions for a Greener Georgia</h3>
          <ul>

              <li><strong>Waste Management and Recycling Programs</strong>: Introducing better waste collection and recycling systems would reduce pollution and support a circular economy.</li>
              <li><strong>Forest Conservation and Reforestation</strong>: Stronger regulations and reforestation projects can help restore degraded lands and protect biodiversity.</li>
              <li><strong>Stronger Environmental Regulations</strong>: Enforcing pollution control measures in industries and improving waste treatment can protect air and water quality.</li>
              <li><strong>Eco-Tourism Development</strong>: Promoting eco-tourism would help preserve Georgia's natural beauty and raise awareness about environmental issues.</li>
